üìÅ Basics and Operators
‚û§ Fundamentals
Declare and print an integer variable

Add two float numbers and print the result

Find size of data types (int, float, double, char)

Swap two variables using a temporary variable

Swap two variables without using a temporary variable

Display ASCII value of a character

Calculate simple interest using SI = (P √ó R √ó T) / 100

Multiply two integers and display result

Find the average of three float numbers

‚û§ Operators
Demonstrate arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %

Demonstrate relational operators: >, <, ==, !=, >=, <=

Demonstrate logical operators: &&, ||, !

Demonstrate bitwise operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

Demonstrate compound assignment: +=, -=, *=, /=, %=

Demonstrate increment/decrement: ++, --

Find maximum of two numbers using ternary operator

Display size of data types using sizeof

üìÅ Pointers and Functions
‚û§ Pointer Basics and Use Cases
What is a pointer in C?
Demonstrates pointer declaration, address referencing, and dereferencing.

Swap two numbers using pointers
Uses void swap(int *x, int *y) to exchange values.

Pointer to a pointer
Example of int **pp and accessing value through double dereferencing.

Output of pointer dereferencing
Simple *p output and memory explanation.

‚û§ Pointer with Functions and Arrays
Pass pointer to a function
Doubles the value of an integer via void doubleValue(int *n).

Reverse array using pointers
Reverses elements using two-pointer technique.

Average using pointer
Calculates average of array elements via pointer arithmetic.

Malloc with pointers
Demonstrates malloc() for dynamic array allocation and safe memory access.

‚û§ Pointers with Strings
Print string character by character using pointers
Uses fgets() and char *ptr to traverse the string.

Length of string using pointer (no array indexing)
Calculates length by iterating with pointer only.

Array of pointers to strings
Stores and prints a list of names using char *names[].
