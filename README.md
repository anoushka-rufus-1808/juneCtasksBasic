📁 Pointers and Functions
➤ Pointer Basics and Use Cases

What is a pointer in C?

Swap two numbers using pointers

Pointer to a pointer (e.g., int **pp)

Output of pointer dereferencing

Print a 3×3 matrix using pointer arithmetic (treat as a linear array)

Find maximum in an array using pointer arithmetic

String comparison using pointers (myStrcmp)

Pointer increment and address difference simulation

Accessing array using pointer/offset notation

Array of pointers to integers

Convert decimal to Roman numeral using array of string pointers

➤ Pointer with Functions and Arrays

Pass pointer to a function (e.g., modify variable by address)

Reverse array using pointers

Calculate average using pointer arithmetic

Calculate string length using pointers (myStrlen)

Copy a string using pointer arithmetic (myStrcpy)

📁 Dynamic Memory Allocation
Use of malloc() to sum elements of a dynamically allocated array

Use of calloc() and comparison with malloc()

📁 Structures and User-Defined Types
➤ Struct Applications

Create and display student record using struct

Extend student struct with nested address struct (address, city, zipcode)

Create and print a list of bank customers using nested structs (customer_name, bank_customer)

Handle bank customer records with string manipulation (strcpy)

➤ Complex Numbers and Math Structures

Define and operate on complex numbers using addcomp() and subcomp()

Use structs to manage complex numbers as a data type

📁 File Handling and I/O
➤ File Operations

Create a file and write a message using fopen() and fprintf()

Use fscanf() and fprintf() with stdin and stdout

Display a custom message using stderr

Read input using getchar() and print using putchar() (until EOF)

Copy contents of one file to another using command-line arguments

Check for file creation errors using fopen() and NULL checks
