# Daily C Programming Tasks  
**Date:** 2nd June 2025  

This repository contains solutions to nine basic C programming problems, focusing on fundamental concepts like variables, arithmetic operations, data types, and input/output.

---

## Task 1: Declare and Print Integer Variable  
**Question:**  
Write a C program to declare an integer variable, assign a value to it, and print the value.  

**Description:**  
Demonstrates declaring an `int` variable, assigning a literal value, and printing it using `printf`.  

---

## Task 2: Add Two Float Numbers  
**Question:**  
Write a C program to add two float numbers and print the result.  

**Description:**  
Reads two float inputs, adds them, and displays the sum formatted with decimal precision.  

---

## Task 3: Find Size of Data Types  
**Question:**  
Write a C program to display the size (in bytes) of `int`, `float`, `double`, and `char` data types.  

**Description:**  
Uses the `sizeof` operator to print memory size of common C data types on the system.  

---

## Task 4: Swap Two Variables Using a Temporary Variable  
**Question:**  
Write a C program to swap the values of two variables using a temporary variable.  

**Description:**  
Illustrates swapping two integer variables by storing one value temporarily during the exchange.  

---

## Task 5: Swap Two Variables Without Using a Temporary Variable  
**Question:**  
Write a C program to swap two integer variables without using a temporary variable.  

**Description:**  
Swaps values by using arithmetic operations (`+` and `-`) or bitwise XOR without extra storage.  

---

## Task 6: Display ASCII Value of a Character  
**Question:**  
Write a C program to display the ASCII value of a character.  

**Description:**  
Reads a character input and prints its ASCII integer value.  

---

## Task 7: Calculate Simple Interest  
**Question:**  
Write a C program to calculate simple interest using the formula:  
`SI = (P × R × T) / 100`, where P is principal, R is rate, and T is time.  

**Description:**  
Takes principal, rate, and time from user input, calculates the simple interest, and displays the result with two decimal places.  

---

## Task 8: Multiply Two Integers  
**Question:**  
Write a C program to multiply two integers and display the result.  

**Description:**  
Reads two integer values from user input, multiplies them, and prints the product.  

---

## Task 9: Find the Average of Three Numbers  
**Question:**  
Write a C program to calculate the average of three float numbers.  

**Description:**  
Reads three floating-point numbers, computes their average, and outputs it formatted to two decimal places.
